  transcript: `This single equation spawned four multi-trillion dollar industries and transformed everyone's approach to risk. Do you think that most people are aware of the size, scale, utility of derivatives? - No. No idea. - But at its core, this equation comes from physics, from discovering atoms, understanding how heat is transferred, and how to beat the casino at blackjack. So maybe it shouldn't be surprising that some of the best to beat the stock market were not veteran traders, but physicists, scientists, and mathematicians. In 1988, a mathematics professor named Jim Simons set up the Medallion Investment Fund, and every year for the next 30 years, the Medallion fund delivered higher returns than the market average, and not just by a little bit, it returned 66% per year. At that rate of growth, $100 invested in 1988 would be worth $8.4 billion today. This made Jim Simons easily the richest mathematician of all time. But being good at math doesn't guarantee success in financial markets. Just ask Isaac Newton. In 1720 Newton was 77 years old, and he was rich. He had made a lot of money working as a professor at Cambridge for decades, and he had a side hustle as the Master of the Royal Mint. His net worth was £30,000 the equivalent of $6 million today. Now, to grow his fortune, Newton invested in stocks. One of his big bets was on the South Sea Company. Their business was shipping enslaved Africans across the Atlantic. Business was booming and the share price grew rapidly. By April of 1720, the value of Newton's shares had doubled. So he sold his stock. But the stock price kept going up and by June, Newton bought back in and he kept buying shares even as the price peaked. When the price started to fall, Newton didn't sell. He bought more shares thinking he was buying the dip. But there was no rebound, and ultimately he lost around a third of his wealth. When asked why he didn't see it coming, Newton responded, "I can calculate the motions of the heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people." So what did Simons get right that Newton got wrong? Well, for one thing, Simons was able to stand on the shoulders of giants. The pioneer of using math to model financial markets was Louis Bachelier, born in 1870. Both of his parents died when he was 18 and he had to take over his father's wine business. He sold the business a few years later and moved to Paris to study physics, but he needed a job to support himself and his family and he found one at the Bourse, The Paris Stock Exchange. And inside was Newton's "madness of people" in its rawest form. Hundreds of traders screaming prices, making hand signals, and doing deals. The thing that captured Bachelier's interest were contracts known as options. The earliest known options were bought around 600 BC by the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus. He believed that the coming summer would yield a bumper crop of olives. To make money off this idea, he could have purchased olive presses, which if you were right, would be in great demand, but he didn't have enough money to buy the machines. So instead he went to all the existing olive press owners and paid them a little bit of money to secure the option to rent their presses in the summer for a specified price. When the harvest came, Thales was right, there were so many olives that the price of renting a press skyrocketed. Thales paid the press owners their pre-agreed price, and then he rented out the machines at a higher rate and pocketed the difference. Thales had executed the first known call option. A call option gives you the right, but not the obligation to buy something at a later date for a set price known as the strike price. You can also buy a put option, which gives you the right, but not the obligation to sell something at a later date for the strike price. Put options are useful if you expect the price to go down. Call options are useful if you expect the price to go up. For example, let's say the current price of Apple stock is a hundred dollars, but you expect it to go up. You could buy a call option for $10 that gives you the right, but not the obligation to buy Apple stock in one year for a hundred dollars. That is the strike price. Just a little side note, American options can be exercised on any date up to the expiry, whereas European options must be exercised on the expiry date. To keep things simple, we'll stick to European options. So if in a year the price of Apple stock has gone up to $130, you can use the option to buy shares for a hundred dollars and then immediately sell them for $130. After you take into account the $10 you paid for the option, you've made a $20 profit. Alternatively, if in a year the stock prices dropped to $70, you just wouldn't use the option and you've lost the $10 you paid for it. So the profit and loss diagram looks like this. If the stock price ends up below the strike price, you lose what you paid for the option. But if the stock price is higher than the strike price, then you earn that difference minus the cost of the option. There are at least three advantages of options. One is that it limits your downside. If you had bought the stock instead of the option and it went down to $70, you would've lost $30. And in theory, you could have lost a hundred if the stock went to zero. The second benefit is options provide leverage. If you had bought the stock and it went up to $130, then your investment grew by 30%. But if you had bought the option, you only had to put up $10. So your profit of $20 is actually a 200% return on investment. On the downside, if you had owned the stock, your investment would've only dropped by 30%, whereas with the option you lose all 100%. So with options trading, there's a chance to make much larger profits, but also much bigger losses. The third benefit is you can use options as a hedge. - I think the original motivation for options was to figure out a way to reduce risk. And then of course, once people decided they wanted to buy insurance, that meant that there are other people out there that wanted to sell it or a profit, and that's how markets get created. - So options can be an incredibly useful investing tool, but what Bachelier saw on the trading floor was chaos, especially when it came to the price of stock options. Even though they had been around for hundreds of years, no one had found a good way to price them. Traders would just bargain to come to an agreement about what the price should be. - Given the option to buy or sell something in the future, it seems like a very amorphous kind of a trade. And so coming up with prices for these rather strange objects has been a challenge that's plagued a number of economists and business people for centuries. - Now, Bachelier, already interested in probability, thought there had to be a mathematical solution to this problem, and he proposed this as his PhD topic to his advisor Henri Poincaré. Looking into the math of finance wasn't really something people did back then, but to Bachelier's surprise, Poincaré agreed. To accurately price an option, first you need to know what happens to stock prices over time. The price of a stock is basically set by a tug of war between buyers and sellers. When more people wanna buy a stock, the price goes up. When more people wanna sell a stock, the price goes down. But the number of buyers and sellers can be influenced by almost anything, like the weather, politics, new competitors, innovation and so on. So Bachelier realized that it's virtually impossible to predict all these factors accurately. So the best you can do is assume that at any point in time the stock price is just as likely to go up as down and therefore over the long term, stock prices follow a random walk, moving up and down as if their next move is determined by the flip of a coin. - Randomness is a hallmark of an efficient market. By efficient economists typically`,

    title: "The Trillion Dollar Equation",
    summary: "The video explores the profound impact of a single mathematical concept—the random walk—on the world of finance, leading to the creation of the 'trillion-dollar equation'. It traces the intellectual history from Louis Bachelier's pioneering application of random walk theory to stock prices in 1900, a concept that predated Einstein's use of it to explain Brownian motion, through the practical innovations of Ed Thorp, who took strategies from the blackjack table to Wall Street. The narrative culminates with the 1973 Black-Scholes-Merton equation, which provided a revolutionary formula for pricing financial options. This breakthrough unlocked the modern derivatives market, now a several-hundred-trillion-dollar industry used by companies and investors globally for hedging and leverage. The video contrasts the theory of an efficient, random market with the real-world success of quantitative investors like Jim Simons, whose Medallion Fund used advanced mathematics and machine learning to consistently beat the market for decades. Ultimately, it reveals a central irony of modern finance: the very act of using science to find predictive patterns in the market helps to eliminate those patterns, pushing the financial world ever closer to a state of perfect, unpredictable randomness.",
